## About me

I'm Faith Okamoto, a bioinformatics PhD student who loves algorithms. I hope to
explore methods to better detect and genotype structural variation. Structural
variants are often much more potent than easy-to-genotype variants, e.g. single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Yet, standard genetic analyses use SNPs because
of how easily, cheaply, and accurately they can be genotyped. I want to bring
more complex variants to the same level of access. We're on the brink of a
genomics revolution and I want to be a part of it.
