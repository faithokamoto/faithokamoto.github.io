Advisor: Dr. Benedict Paten ([UCSC Computational Genomics Lab][CGL])

## About me

I'm Faith Okamoto, a bioinformatics PhD student who loves algorithms. I work on
methods to better handle complex genomic regions. To that end I'm extending and
applying the [vg toolkit][vg]. Pangenome sequence-graph references are supposed
to better represent genetic variation compared to linear references. But
pangenomic algorithms aren't quite as mature as we'd like them to be, so they
still struggle with those complex regions. My job? Fix that.
