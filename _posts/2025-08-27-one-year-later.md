A year ago, I published [my first blog post][ProcessBlog] here. I wasn't
sure how long I would keep going, but clearly I haven't stopped yet! I'm about
to start on my second year as a PhD student. Soon I'll be helping to run a
bootcamp for incoming PhD students. The same bootcamp I took around a year ago.

This blog has been a great way for me to reflect on how I code. I've enjoyed
putting my process and opinions into words. And at least a few people claim to
have found at least a few of my posts useful. I can't be sure if they were just
trying to save my feelings, but I appreciated it all the same.

To celebrate having a year and 33 (!!) blog posts (not counting this one), I've
set up a [new page][PostList] that is just a list of all of my posts in 
chronological order. This means you<sup>1</sup> can peruse all my titles at
leisure. Maybe if I get to a hundred posts I'll have to set up collapsible
sections, but for now it seems fine.

1. Well, really, "you" is me. When writing new posts I often look up old ones.
