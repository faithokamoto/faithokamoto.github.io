My qualifying exams are approaching at the end of the academic year. In
addition, I have several other personal projects which I will be devoting time
to. Thus, for the foreseeable future of this year, I will be updating every
other week, unless I have something I _want_ to blog about. This probably means
frequency will drop somewhat.

As always, you can subscribe to my RSS feed (bottom of the page) to get
notified of my updates. Though I would be genuinely surprised if anyone did.
